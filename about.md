### Open analytics data

Analytics should always be 100% anonymous, aggregated, open and public - otherwise it's spying.

You can view this website's analytics at [opendata.hexops.com](https://opendata.hexops.com/devlog.hexops.com).

We use a self-hosted instance of the open source [Plausible.io](https://plausible.io) server for this:

> By using Plausible Analytics, all the site measurement is carried
> out absolutely anonymously. Cookies are not set and no personal
> data is collected. All data is in aggregate only. The website owner
> gets some actionable data to help them learn and improve, while the
> visitor keeps having a nice and enjoyable experience.
